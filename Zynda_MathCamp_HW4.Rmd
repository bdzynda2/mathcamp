A set is convex if and only if every convex combination of vectors in S is also in S. 

(1) If every combination of vectors in S is also in S, then a set is convex. 

This proof is evident from the definition of a convex set, that is:

A set S is convex in vector space $V$ if for any two points $x,y$ in $S$ and $\lambda$ in the unit interval $(0,1)$ the point $(1-\lambda)x + \lambda y$ is in S. 

Clearly, if every combination of vectors is convex in $S$, then there will be two that fulfill that definition of convexity.

(2) A set is convex if every convex combination of vectros in $S$ is also in $S$.
